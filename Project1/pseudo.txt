cmd == everything

cd\n
ls\n
./a.out\n



total_command_list[i] == strtok(cmd, "\n")

[0] == cd
[1] = ls ...

cmd = fdssd
while (cmd compare != quit or exit) {

while (fgets...)
{}
// file reading is done (if it ever happened)
 stdin == user input
}

if commands[1] == '>' {
	stdout = c[2]

} else if c[1] == '<' {
	stdin = c[2]
}

strtok (cmd, "|");
basically get left & right side of pipe

create pipe

change stdout of left to pipe
after executing left,
change stdin of right to pipe
execute right



if we change to strtok

first its split by newline
split by | > < 
then splitting by " "

./prog sdf sd > a.txt
ls
